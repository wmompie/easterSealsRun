            <h2>Easterseals Commitment</h2>
            <p>
              For the past 95 years, Easter Seals has played an important role
              in providing support for children and youth with physical
              disabilities. Thanks to our generous donors, we continue to offer
              programs that allow kids to experience freedom, independence and a
              sense of accomplishment. For families, Easter Seals is somewhere
              to turn for help when they need it.
            </p>
            <p>
              Easter Seals is a registered charitable organization that helps
              children and youth with physical disabilities from all ethnic and
              religious backgrounds. We assist families with the purchase of
              costly mobility equipment such as wheelchairs, walkers, porch
              lifts and ramps, as well as communication devices, toileting aids
              and bathing equipment. Easter Seals also offers post-secondary
              scholarships and provides access to information and resources, and
              public education and awareness.

                Easterseals Run is a national fundraiser to support the work of
                Easterseals. For nearly 100 years, Easterseals has been helping
                people with disabilities and their families, caregivers,
                veterans and seniors get the services and supports they need to
                reach their full potential.
              </p>
              <p>
                Individual walkers and teams join hundreds of other passionate
                people in their communities for a day full of entertainment, fun
                and, of course, our signature walk! Since 2003, over 230,000
                people have participated in 615 Easterseals Run events
                nationwide generating nearly &#36;41 million to support families
                at Easterseals. This year, you can help Easterseals accomplish
                even more!
              </p>
              <p>
                Each participant's motivation to walk is unique; it may be for
                themselves, a child of a loved one, a neighbor or a colleague.
                20&#37; of the US population lives with a disability today- like
                autism which has become a significant issue for too many
                families. We walk for them, their future and the families who
                love them. Easterseals Run to help people with disabilities
                live, learn, work and play.
              </p>
              <p>
                Every walk event is different -- your walk could be at a local
                school or at the aquarium! But every walk is a lifeline of funds
                that enables your local Easterseals to continue providing vital
                services and support to people with disabilities and their
                families.

              <h4 class="text-center">How Your Money Helps</h4>
              <h5>Financial</h5>
              <p>
                Children with physical disabilities require costly equipment to
                meet basic needs, live safely, and strive for independence. The
                families of these children face not only personal sacrifice, but
                also a heavy financial burden. It can cost families more than
                &#36;40,000 a year to care for a child with a severe disability,
                and as children grow, equipment must be replaced. Government
                agencies cover only partial costs of certain pieces of equipment
                necessary to these children for personal safety, mobility, and
                communication, and for some pieces, not at all.
              </p>
              <p>
                Extra family expenses can include: home renovations, adaptive
                equipment and devices, special schooling, special transportation
                and adapted vehicles, time away from work for medical
                appointments and surgeries, plus the cost of care givers, to
                name a few.
              </p>

                Of the families who requested financial assistance from Easter
                Seals and self-reported their annual income in 2016, 61&#37;
                reported a total family income under &#36;60,000. In addition,
                45&#37; of families had a total annual household income under
                &#36;40,000; and 24&#37; had a total family income under
